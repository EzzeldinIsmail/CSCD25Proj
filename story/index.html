            <h2 class="text-5xl">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="text-xl">
                In the recept paper <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/22177/21956">'Echo Tunnels: Polarized News Sharing Online Runs 
                Narrow but Deep'</a>, an analysis was done on how echo chambers on Reddit and 
                how common they are across the 10K most active subreddits. This analysis concluded that echo chambers are not actually a common phenomenon 
                which intuitively makes sense since most subreddits are not political in nature. What was discovered instead was that echo chambers tend to be
                extremely strong in hyper-partisan communities e.g. r/Conservatives, r/democrats.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl">
                This analysis was conducted using a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04167-x">community embedding</a> that provides granular
                characterizations of each subreddits political leanings based on a modified version of word2vec. However, due to Reddit's inherent 
                <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/04/07/partisan-differences-in-social-media-use-show-up-for-some-platforms-but-not-facebook/">
                    left leaning
                bias</a>, this results in much larger values (in absolute terms) for conservative subreddits than progressive subreddits. Later in the analysis, the 
                news sites that were shared in each subreddit were analyzed and given a score based on which subreddits they were shared in and how much. Because
                Conservative subreddits were given larger values that made them appear more 'extremist' than their progressive counterparts, this resulted in some
                exclusively conservative news organizations such as the daily wire appearing far more right wing than any exclusively left-wing news organizations 
                such as mother jones. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl">
                My analysis will be similar to the paper, but will be focused on comparing news consumption across the political axis and what that tells us about
                the communities and the news sources analyzed.
                
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-5xl">Methodology</h2>
            <h3 class="text-4xl">Community embedding</h2>
            <p class="text-xl">
                Each subreddits partisan score was retrieved using the community embedding, where each subreddit was given a score based on how close it was to the 
                seed subreddits (r/Conservative, r/democrats). Due to Reddit's left-leaning nature, two different normalization techniques where used. The first scaled
                the normal distribution linearly so that the highest and lowest value points where at 1 and -1 respectively. This maintained the normal distribution
                shape while giving an equal comparison between the most left wing and the most right wing subreddits. This method also moved the mean from right 
                leaning to left leaning, unearthing how certain left-leaning communities were marked as more right leaning due to the biased mean of subreddits being
                left-leaning. The second method split the communities based on their leanings, and then scaled each individually from -1 to 0 and 0 to 1 respectively.
                This maintained the same number of 
                left and right leaning subreddits as the original values but deformed the shape of the curve as the left-leaning communities were scaled more 
                due to their initial low values. This resulted in a higher number of left leaning communities who were more than 3 standard deviations from the
                mean and less right leaning distributions more than 3 standard deviations from the mean, the areas that would be considered 'extremist'.

            <h3 class="text-4xl">News rating</h2>
            <p class="text-xl">
                For each news organization, a bias rating was retrieved using AllSides, an independent organization that measures the bias of news sources. 
                However, from the sources selected for research more were left leaning than right leaning. Therefore, a secondary score was calculated which
                scaled all the bias ratings to be between -1 and 1 similar to above. This is to reduces the mislabeling of subreddits as left-leaning when they
                could have an even distribution of news from all sources.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-4xl">Partisanship Scores</h2>
                <p class="text-xl">
                    For each subreddit, an Allsides score was derived as an average of the scores derived from links shared in the subreddit. So each link shared
                    from a news source would have corresponding Allsides rating, and an average was taken over all these scores. This was similarly done for
                    the scaled Allsides ratings.
                </p>
                <p class="text-xl">
                    For each news source, a partisan rating would be derived as an average of the scores derived from the subreddits that were sharing links from 
                    the news source. This was similarly done for the scaled normalized values for the subreddits, but not for the scores that were split and 
                    scaled separately due to their unbalanced nature that labeled way too many left-leaning subreddits as far-left.
                </p>

            <h2 class="text-5xl">Results</h2>
            <h3 class="text-4xl">News scores</h2>
            <p class="text-xl">
                Although the overall distribution of the scores were the same between the original and scaled values, the magnitude of the differences between
                left leaning and right leaning sources decreased. For example, with the original partisan subreddit values, Fox News was considered almost 6x
                as partisan as CNN. However, after the scaling CNN was considered 15% more partisan. While exclusively right-leaning organization still had much
                larger values than the other news organizations, mainstream right leaning news organizations like the washington times, were now closer to their 
                left-leaning counterparts like NPR.

            <h3 class="text-4xl">Subreddit Scores</h2>
                <p class="text-xl">
                    There was a considerable difference between the distributions of the subreddit scores from the Allsides rating and the scaled rating. The 
                    Allsides rating classified more subreddits as center (withing one standard deviation) and many less as left of center (56 vs 127). It also
                    classified less no left-leaning subreddit as far-left (>3 standard deviation to the left). It also classified less subreddits as right-leaning
                    but many more as right (41 vs 20) and far-right (16 vs 3). The scaled score gave a more even distribution across the spectrum with similar 
                    values for opposite partisan leanings.

            <p>
                In conclusion, Reddit's left leaning bias has caused a miscalibration in the models that cause them to classify right leaning news as further right
                than anticipated. When comparing both left and right leaning subreddits equally, we see that while there are undoubtedly many extremely right wing 
                news organizations that have no comparison in the left like Newsmax, The Daily Wire, and The blaze, there is a varied distribution around the center. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The news bias rating has a high corelation with the subreddits embedding score with r2=.8. However, the subreddits media bias rating is not so 
                strongly correlated with r2=.03.
